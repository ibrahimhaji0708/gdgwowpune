# AI/ML Workshop at MIT-WPU - April 20, 2025

## Exploring AI/ML and Building an MCP Server

Today, we had an incredible learning experience at the AI/ML workshop hosted by Google Developer Group Pune (GDGOC) at MIT World Peace University. The workshop provided both beginners and intermediate developers with hands-on experience in artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts.

### Workshop Highlights:

1. **Introduction to AI/ML**: We started with the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and machine learning, understanding the difference between traditional programming and machine learning approaches.

2. **Practical Applications**: The workshop demonstrated real-world applications of AI/ML technologies across various industries including healthcare, finance, and education.

3. **Hands-on Learning**: The most exciting part was getting our hands dirty with code! We learned how to implement basic machine learning models and understand their inner workings.

4. **MCP Server Project**: As part of the workshop, we built a Machine Control Protocol (MCP) server, which allowed us to understand how AI systems can control and communicate with various devices and services.

### Key Takeaways:

- Understanding the importance of data preprocessing in ML pipelines
- Learning about different model evaluation techniques
- Gaining practical experience in setting up an MCP server architecture
- Networking with other developers interested in AI/ML technologies

We are grateful to the GDG Pune team and MIT-WPU for organizing this enriching workshop. Looking forward to applying these newly acquired skills in future projects!
