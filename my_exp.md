# My Experience at GDG Pune Workshop

## AI/ML Workshop - April 20, 2025

Today I had the opportunity to attend the AI/ML workshop organized by Google Developer Group Pune at MIT-WPU. It was an enriching experience where I learned about several cutting-edge technologies:

### Machine Control Protocol (MCP)

We learned about MCP and how it serves as a communication standard for AI systems to interact with various devices and services. The hands-on session helped me understand:

- How to set up an MCP server
- The architecture behind client-server communication in AI environments
- Security considerations when implementing MCP
- Practical applications in IoT and smart device management

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

One of the most interesting topics covered was RAG systems, which combine retrieval-based and generative AI approaches:

- The difference between traditional LLMs and RAG-enhanced systems
- How to implement a basic RAG pipeline using vector databases
- Techniques for improving response accuracy and relevance
- Real-world applications of RAG in customer service and documentation

### Additional Learning

The workshop also covered:

- Fine-tuning LLMs for specific tasks
- Evaluation metrics for AI/ML models
- Ethical considerations in AI development
- Best practices for deploying AI systems in production

I'm excited to apply these concepts in my own projects and continue exploring the fascinating world of AI and machine learning!
